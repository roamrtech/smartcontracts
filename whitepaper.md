## Abstract 
With increased advancements in the internet and GPS technologies, drones have become very powerful business tools despite their military origin. In fact, its use has increased tremendously. The manners in which governments and businesses carry out their activities have been altered by drones.
The use of drones has transformed everything from serial activities to security to management and maintenance to goods and services delivery and it has also taken a new dimension in the emerging internet of things infrastructures as nodes. Compared to sensors, drones allow the users a wide resource in information gathering. The world at large seems to be only just starting out on a journey of how drones will affect technological infrastructure of the future and how it will push the limit of possibilities.
Today, Drones efficiency compared to that of humans with respect to data collection is incredible, with drones accomplish such tasks in hours instead of days or weeks. It is economical for acquiring deeply detailed visual data for a little fraction of the cost when compared with other means. It is frequently deployed for precarious situations and crucial in workplace safety.
Emphasis has been placed of finding a solution to the safe co-existence of drones and manned aircrafts. Roamr is working on a harmonized network for air traffic management (ATM) and Drone/UAS traffic management and is building an Intelligent, Decentralized, conscious, autonomous drone traffic management platform that will ensure safe flights of manned and unmanned aircrafts in the shared airspace.
Traffic gridlocks and congestions worldwide costs time for millions daily. On-demand passenger drones can radically improve urban mobility thereby saving lost time daily. Vertical Take-off and landing (VTOL) are small electric aircrafts that can take off and land vertically and as such will enable reliable and fast transportation within cities and reduce traffic congestions.
Cargo drones are being used for goods transportation because it offers numerous advantages. It is not constrained by road infrastructure and congestion and can deliver packages faster than wheeled vehicles from close-by storage location.it can easily fly over water bodies, rural areas with poor infrastructure and difficult terrains (mountains, forest) with relative ease to deliver cargoes. 
The drone marketplace application allows users, buyers and sellers of drone products and services to connect seamlessly. To purchase and rent drones, hire drones for their operations/projects, buy drones spare parts, book drone taxis, cargo/package delivery using the marketplace.
Note: the terms UAS (Unmanned Aircraft System), UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), RPS (Remotely Piloted Air System) and Drone are used interchangeably. 
The word “Drones” will be used for the remainder of this paper for proper understanding since it can easily be understood. By using the word “Drones”, we are referring to any aircraft with no pilot onboard either remotely controlled or flown autonomously through software-controlled flight plans working in conjunction with onboard sensors and GPS.

## Introduction
# Definition of Drones 
They are any aircraft with no pilot onboard either remotely controlled or flown autonomously through software-controlled flight plans working in conjunction with onboard sensors and Global Positioning System (GPS). 
Until recently, UAS were either prohibitively expensive, limiting their use to government and research organizations or they were of relatively low performance both in utility and the likelihood of interaction with other airspace users. Technological advancements over the years have produced a decrease in costs of production and maintenance and increase in performance which has led to an unprecedented interest in the development of drones. Rapid increase in applications for both military and civil use has been spiked by relatively cheap, high performance platforms.
Within increase in drone use in government, commercial and leisure sectors, small drones have been projected to become one of the most dynamic sectors in the aviation industry in coming years. Estimations by the federal aviation administration reveals that there are currently 11 million drones currently operational in the U.S. and this is set to increase to between 2.7 million and 4.4 million units by 2021. The commercial drone fleet stands currently at 4,200 units, with increase set for over 400,000 commercial drones in service by 2021. 

# Major Use Cases
    • Security and Surveillance
A number of industries conduct surveillance using drones outfitted with high resolution or infrared camera. Drones are also used by security personnel to monitor shopping centers and corporate offices. Law enforcement agencies could also use drones as an aid in investigating crimes, for tracking suspects or to protect the nations border.

    • Goods Delivery
The delivery of packaged goods and other mail is a potential widespread use of drones.  In addition to making deliveries to a specific location, drones can also fly to and from designated hubs or pickup stations. For example, a retailer delivering packaged goods to a specific location. Such deliveries save costs and time when compared with other conventional means of delivery.

    • Data Collection
Scientist use Drones to collect real time meteorological information about natural phenomenon’s (e.g. earthquakes, hurricanes)

    • Emergency Response
Drones can aid in search and rescue operations or to help find missing people in difficult to access areas. It can be used by emergency personnel to respond to situations where human life is in danger. Drones can deliver supplies in disaster struck areas and can help fight bushfires by dispersing firefighting chemicals.

    • Agriculture
In Agricultural operations, the application of Drones is wide. It can be used to capture aerial images to monitor crop growth, to detect pests, weeds, flooding or drought conditions and nitrogen deficiencies. Drone with data collection capabilities can also measure heights and generate topographical maps and models for land levelling and drainage application. Farmers can use drones for air pollination and crop spraying. Drones are being experimented in cloud seedling which may increase precipitation by releasing silver iodide into a storm to generate additional rain.

    • Construction
Commercial construction and architectural firms have found drone imagery and data useful in design and preconstruction works. Drones can also be used for onsite monitoring by engineers simply to capture pictures for periodical reports. Drones can assist in identifying issues and allow onsite managers resolve them quickly leading to performance enhancements. Drones can also be used to collect data on accurate topography maps with elevation contour lines to generate plans and detailed 2d and 3d models.

    • Urban Air Transportation
Traffic gridlocks and congestions worldwide costs time for millions daily. On-demand passenger drones can radically improve urban mobility thereby saving lost time daily. Vertical Take-off and landing (VTOL) are small electric aircrafts that can take off and land vertically which can improve urban mobility thereby saving costs and time and as such will enable reliable and fast transportation within cities and reduce traffic congestions
.
    • Infrastructure Inspection and Claim Handling
Insurance firms and structural engineering firms can benefit from the use of drones. Drones can be used for inspections on roofs, roads, bridges, dams and to survey damaged structures. They provide information for insurers and risk managers in evaluating claims and other exposures.

    • Hazardous Material Assessment
Drone has been successfully used in assessment of situations that are deemed hazardous to human life and health such as chemical spills, contagious diseases outbreak, radiation leaks, etc.

## Our Vision
Roamr is working on a harmonized network for Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Drone/UAS Traffic Management and is building a cutting edge, Intelligent, Decentralized, Conscious, Autonomous Drone Traffic Management platform that will ensure safe flights of manned and unmanned aircrafts in the shared airspace. The platform will be driven by AII and blockchain technologies.
Roamr Passenger and Cargo Drones will completely transform the urban transportation system by bring on demand deliveries to your doorsteps. On-demand passenger drones can radically improve urban mobility thereby saving lost time daily. Vertical Take-off and landing (VTOL) are small electric aircrafts that can take off and land vertically which can improve urban mobility thereby saving costs and time and as such will enable reliable and fast transportation
Roamr Drone Marketplace will be a hub for any drone related products and services. It will connect both buyers and sellers of drone products seamlessly and efficiently. It will allow users to allows users to purchase and rent drones, hire drones for their operations/projects, buy drones spare parts, book drone taxis, cargo/package delivery using the marketplace.

## Services
# • Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) Platform
As we head into the future where there will be billions of flights from millions of drones, innovators are constantly identifying new, beneficial applications for UAS like infrastructure inspection, goods delivery, 3d mapping, disaster relief, search and rescue etc. the absence of A Pilot on board raises concern about how to handle dangerous situations and to detect and avoid traffic. Airborne collision avoidance systems are not designed to deal with denser traffic but can protect the unmanned aircraft from damage. The risks posed by UAS operations to people and property include injury to persons and damage to property which are compounded in a densely populated urban environment. 

At present there is no system to manage unmanned air traffic. Conventional air traffic management system relies on voice communications between air traffic controllers and pilots and on radar detection and thus cannot be applied to unmanned aircraft. Drones today are rather too small and operate too close to the ground for any radar to be of any use. Larger drones may have to be equipped with voice recognition/speech synthesis radio and have a significantly large radar cross-section. The current airspace management and traffic flow management do no have the facilities and capabilities to handle all drone operations.

For air traffic management for manned aircraft requires human, manual process, built to prevent collisions between planes, known as deconfliction. Drones on the other hand, fly in low altitude airspace, they will need a complex universe of data to map and understand the environment around them and facilities to communicate with each other in low altitude airspace. They will need a much more detailed picture of their world and their obstacles and events within it, powerlines, building heights, microscale weather and even the times and locations of community gatherings etc.
UTM is the infrastructure that will allow drones operate seamlessly with other drones, airspace management services, manned aircraft and other air stakeholders.

We are currently researching technologies such as airspace design, dynamic geofencing, congestion management, terrain avoidance, route planning, re-routing separation management, sequencing and space and contingency management for a UAS traffic management (UTM) system that will develop airspace integration requirements for enabling safe, efficient low altitude operations of drones Roamr UTM includes things like universal drone registration standards, open identification systems, tamper proof flight data recorders, accurate and trustworthy 3D mapping data, dynamic weather information and vehicle to vehicle communication.

We are building an AI driven, autonomous, self-governing, intelligent drone/unmanned aircraft system (UAS), traffic management (UTM) platform on the blockchain that will be able to satisfy all requirements for operations in a shared airspace. Our platform will harmonize integration between UTM systems globally and enable industry, including manufacturers, service providers and end users to use drones safely and efficiently without disrupting the existing manned aviation system. It will not require human operators to continuously monitor every vehicle.
Roamr’s UTM platform will involve two systems:
    I. Portable UTM would move between geographical areas and support operations using precision agriculture or disaster relief.
    II. Persistent UTM would provide continuous coverage for a specific geographical area. Human mangers would use data to make strategic decisions about initiating, continuing and terminating UAAS flights to ensure that only authenticated UAS are in the airspace.
    
Roamr’s UTM platform will provide data such as airspace requirements and rules, alerts about manned traffic, locations of critical infrastructure, weather conditions and other obstacles to drones and their operators.
Through our Roamr-Reg systems, Drone operators will submit digital flight plans and receive flight authorization and will also connect other stakeholders to the systems so they can get updates on shared flight notices in cases of emergency or hazard.

   ## • Passenger Drones
Daily worldwide, millions of hours are wasted on roads due to traffic jams and congestion on roads. On-demand passenger drones can radically improve urban mobility thereby saving lost time daily. Vertical Take-off and landing (VTOL) are small electric aircrafts that can take off and land vertically which can improve urban mobility thereby saving costs and time and as such will enable reliable and fast transportation within cities and decongest the roads. We envision that a network of self-flying autonomous drones or “passenger drones” big enough to transport individual commuters will reduce time of transportation hugely. Urban air transportation will use three-dimensional airspace to decongest traffic on the ground similar to how skyscrapers allow cities to use limited land area effectively.

Roamr will work closely with leading passenger drone manufacturers like Volocopter, Ehang, Autonomous passenger Drone and Workhorse to launch Drone Taxi service on its marketplace. Passengers will be able to book drone taxis on the app and drone taxi fleet owners will be able to deploy taxi fleets on the market place.
Cargo Drones are being used for goods transportation because it offers numerous advantages. It is not constrained by road infrastructure and congestion and can deliver packages faster than wheeled vehicles from close-by storage location.it can easily fly over water bodies, rural areas with poor infrastructure and difficult terrains (mountains, forest) with relative ease to deliver cargoes. 

A widespread use of drones involves the delivery of packages goods and other mal. In addition to making deliveries to a specific shipping address, drones could fly to and from designated hubs or pickup stations. For example, a retailer could use a drone to deliver goods or documents to an assigned location where customers would receive their packages. Such delivery reportedly may be completed in less time [and at lower cost] than conventional means of delivery.
Users will be able to book cargo drones and cargo drone fleet owners will be able to deploy their drone fleets on the marketplace application.

    # • Drone Market Place
The drone marketplace allows users, buyers and sellers of drone products and services to connect seamlessly. To purchase and rent drones, hire drones for their operations/projects, buy drones spare parts, book drone taxis, cargo/package delivery using the marketplace.
The entire economy will be powered by Roamr’s tokens.
