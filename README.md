# Overview

This repository contains the code that powers RoamrDrone. We've completely open-sourced all of our smart contracts, and written comprehensive test suites to ensure that they're air-tight. We've also included some best-practice sample code for programmatic interactions with our contracts. Current projects include:

    roamr-token-and-server-raindrop: Raomr Token and Server-Side Raindrop
    client-raindrop: Client-Side Raindrop
    snowflake: Identity Management
